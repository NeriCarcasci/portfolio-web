## Overview
Led architecture and development from MVP through pilot customers and seed funding.

## Problem
We needed to ship quickly with a small team while establishing foundations that could scale.

## Approach
Chose a pragmatic stack with containerized services and managed databases, built core APIs and client apps, and established CI/CD early.

## Impact
Launched the MVP in 4 months, secured 3 pilot customers, and raised seed funding. The architecture supported 10x growth without major rewrites.
