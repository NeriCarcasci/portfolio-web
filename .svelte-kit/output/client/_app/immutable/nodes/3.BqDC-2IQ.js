            built a production system now used by planning professionals across Ireland. The work focused on building 
            traceable, explainable AI infrastructure for regulated decision-making—combining document ingestion pipelines, 
            retrieval-augmented reasoning, and workflow-aware tooling into a system where every output can be audited 
            and defended.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">The core principle: if the reasoning cannot be traced and explained, the output cannot be used. This shaped 
            every architectural decision, from citation enforcement to strict separation between AI assistance and human 
            decision authority.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">The platform is live in production, operating commercially with enterprise pilots, and backed by <strong class="svelte-cwls5q">Enterprise Ireland's New Frontiers</strong> programme. This taught me how to balance technical 
            rigor with commercial realism—building systems that work under actual use, not just in ideal conditions.</p></div></div> <div class="space-y-4 svelte-cwls5q"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 svelte-cwls5q">Enterprise & Production Engineering</h3> <div class="embedded-panel space-y-4 svelte-cwls5q"><p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">At <strong class="svelte-cwls5q">Red Hat's Trusted AI team</strong>, I rebuilt the internal metrics platform for ML model governance, 
            added drift detection capabilities, and exposed new APIs for cross-team integration. The work required navigating 
            existing production infrastructure, understanding how teams actually use ML monitoring tools, and delivering 
            improvements without breaking existing workflows.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">This experience reinforced the importance of backwards compatibility, incremental improvement, and building for 
            maintainability in large-scale engineering environments. Production ML is software engineering with extra 
            uncertainty—it requires monitoring, versioning, testing, and realistic expectations about model behavior over time.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">Earlier work at <strong class="svelte-cwls5q">EY</strong> involved backend development, API design, database optimization, and CI/CD 
            pipeline construction—core engineering that matters regardless of whether AI is involved.</p></div></div> <div class="space-y-4 svelte-cwls5q"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 svelte-cwls5q">Teaching & Mentoring</h3> <div class="embedded-panel space-y-4 svelte-cwls5q"><p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">I've taught technical workshops, mentored students, and tutored in computer science fundamentals.

            secondary school through university—helping them understand not just syntax, but systems thinking and problem 
            decomposition.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">Teaching clarifies thinking. Explaining how something works forces you to understand it more deeply. This applies 
            to code reviews, documentation, and technical communication just as much as formal instruction.</p></div></div></section> <section class="space-y-6 svelte-cwls5q"><h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-white svelte-cwls5q">Education & Foundations</h2> <div class="embedded-panel space-y-4 svelte-cwls5q"><p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">I'm completing a <strong class="svelte-cwls5q">BSc (Hons) in Computing with Machine Learning & AI at TU Dublin</strong>, where my 
          graduate thesis focuses on explainable Graph Neural Networks for financial crime detection. The work involves 
          implementing and evaluating multiple explainability methods (SHAP, LIME, GNNExplainer, Counterfactual-GNN) 
          on the Elliptic2 dataset—a real-world benchmark for anti-money laundering detection in cryptocurrency networks.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">The research addresses a practical problem: GNNs can model complex relational patterns in financial transactions, 
          but they operate as black boxes. For regulated financial institutions, this lack of transparency is a barrier to 
          adoption. Building explainability into these models means balancing performance with interpretability—making 
          systems that are both effective and trustworthy.</p> <p class="leading-relaxed text-neutral-200 svelte-cwls5q">My academic work emphasizes applied learning—understanding not just how algorithms work, but when and why to 
          use them, what their failure modes are, and how they behave in production contexts.</p></div></section> <section class="space-y-6 svelte-cwls5q"><h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-white svelte-cwls5q">What I Care About as an Engineer</h2> <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 svelte-cwls5q"></div></section> <section class="space-y-6 svelte-cwls5q"><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-400 text-center svelte-cwls5q">Worked With / Recognised By</h2> <div class="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-8 items-center justify-items-center py-8 svelte-cwls5q"></div></section> <section class="border-t border-white/10 pt-12 space-y-6 svelte-cwls5q"><p class="text-lg text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed svelte-cwls5q">If you want to see what I've built, explore <a href="/projects" class="text-emerald-400 hover:underline svelte-cwls5q">Projects</a>.
